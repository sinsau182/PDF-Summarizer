 E-marketing, also known as online or digital marketing, involves promoting products or services on the internet through various technologies and media. It offers advantages over traditional marketing by providing greater convenience, competitive prices, and reduced operational costs for businesses, as well as instant response, cost-efficiency, and interactivity for customers. However, e-marketing is dependent on technology and the internet, faces worldwide competition, privacy and security issues, higher transparency and price competition, and maintenance costs. Different types of e-marketing include email, social media, video, article, and affiliate marketing.
